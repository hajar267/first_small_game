✨ Rock, Paper, Scissors — Python Beginner Project
🐍 About the Project
This is a simple Rock, Paper, Scissors game written in Python, as part of my first steps learning the language.

The player competes against the computer by choosing rock, paper, or scissors, and the winner is decided based on classic rules.
